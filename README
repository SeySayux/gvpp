Installation instructions

1) Copy gvpp and gvpp.pl to somewhere in your path
2) Edit gvpp to reflect the path to gvpp.pl

Usage instructions

First write all nodes, then write all edges, e.g, K3 would be:

    1
    2
    3
    1 -- 2
    1 -- 3
    2 -- 3

All additional GraphViz options are supported too, e.g. [label="foo"] would add
"foo" as a label.

Also see the examples in the examples/ directory.

Then, run gvpp myfile.dot . For digraphs, use gvpp -d .
